This zip file contains supplemental materials for Analyzing Health Equity Using Household Survey Data by Owen O'Donnell, Eddy van Doorslaer, Adam Wagstaff, and Magnus Lindelow. 
Each chapter has a Powerpoint presentation. Most also have Stata code and data for the worked example in the book – see the “do” (command) file and a “dta” (data) file. 
Some of the do files require that the dominance.ado file be copied to your “ado\plus\d” folder. (To find out the location of your ado / plus folders, type “sysdir” in the Stata window. To change the location to, say, the D: drive, type “sysdir set PLUS "D:\ ado\plus".)  
Also included is a spreadsheet “concentrationindex.xlsx” which computes the concentration index and its standard error for grouped data.
